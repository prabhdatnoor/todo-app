# todo-app

to run:

```
git clone https://github.com/prabhdatnoor/todo-app/
docker-compose up
```

DB runs at port 5438 external, backend is on 5001 external. Feel free to change it to whatever you like in the `docker-compose.yml` and `backend/Dockerfile `

Currently `db/password.txt` is not needed and the default "postgres" password is used for the DB
